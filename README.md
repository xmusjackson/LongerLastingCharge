<h2 align="center">A mod for My Summer Car by Xmusjackson</h2>

This repository contains the code for a My Summer Car mod which provides configurable sliders for the discharge rate of the Flashlight and the Boombox. The mod requires MCSLoader >= 1.3.1 (untested on older or newer versions)

The sliders are available in the MCSLoader menu by clicking the gear icon under the mod's label. There will be two sliders, One to control the Boombox and the other to control the Flashlight. 

The two work a little differently; The Boombox takes a number to be used as the consumption divider. The game divides 1 by this number and multiplies that by the volume level to get the discharge rate (the amount of charge lost per second). A higher number will result in a longer charge duration.

The flashlight takes the consumption rate directly instead. In this case, a lower value will result in a longer charge duration.

Note: For the flashlight, a dishcarge rate of zero will result in an infinite flashlight!
